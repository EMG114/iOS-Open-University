# iOS Open University

## What is it?

This is my curated list of awesome Swift and iOS Resources to support my multi-month study plan for becoming a self-taught iOS Developer. Anyone who wants to learn iOS App Development and want to get a job as an iOS Developer can follow this path.

I'm aware of the fact that this might not be the one and only plan to become an iOS Developer, but this is my way of learning anything new. And I believe the resources mentioned are pretty good.

These resources are best recommended if you're taking a challenge like #100DaysOfCode or [#301DaysOfCode]()

## Some Motivation to get you Started

* [14-Year-Old Prodigy Programmer Dreams In Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXZWB_dNsw)
* [Facebook's Youngest Engineer - Michael Sayman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmQG_BCiVHU)
* [A 12-year-old app developer | Thomas Suarez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd9TWUtFm0)
* [Life of an Indie App Developer - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVRtJbXQsL8)

## Choose a Language:

To start learning iOS App Development, you'll need a programming language of your choice. There are two programming languages from which you can choose: Objective-C and Swift. For a beginner, I'll prefer starting with Swift.

### Swift Resources for a Beginner:

#### Books:
* [Swift Programming - Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/swift-programming/)

* [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read)

#### Video Tutorials:

* [Swift Track - Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-swift)

* [The iOS Developer Nanodegree - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003)

#### Youtube Playlists:

* [The Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8btZwalbjYlRZh8Q1VK80Ly0YsZ7PZxx)

* [Getting Started with Swift 3 - Apple WWDC 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzesJrOcFDU)

* [Swift 3 for Beginners - The Swifty Nerd](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvMYZOwDO7r3gDF1f23pWb19Awdt_wHom)

Learning from video tutorials isn't enough. If you want to have a strong foundation of Swift, I recommend you to finish the Swift - Big Nerd Ranch Guide, before messing with iOS App Development.

Also, enrolling in any iOS Development Courses on Udemy as a complete beginner (with no understanding of Swift) will not help.

### Advanced Swift:

#### Books:
