## What is it?

This is my curated list of awesome Swift and iOS Resources to support my multi-month study plan for becoming a self-taught iOS Developer.

## Some Motivation to get you Started

* [14-Year-Old Prodigy Programmer Dreams In Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXZWB_dNsw)
* [Facebook's Youngest Engineer - Michael Sayman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmQG_BCiVHU)
* [Life of an Indie App Developer - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVRtJbXQsL8)

## Beginner

To start learning iOS App Development, you'll need a programming language of your choice. There are two programming languages from which you can choose: Objective-C and Swift. For a beginner, I'll prefer starting with Swift.

### Swift Resources for a Beginner:

#### Books:
* [Swift Programming - Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/swift-programming/)

* [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read)

#### Video Tutorials:

* [Swift Track - Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-swift)

* [The iOS Developer Nanodegree - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003)

#### Youtube Playlists:

* [The Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8btZwalbjYlRZh8Q1VK80Ly0YsZ7PZxx)

* [Getting Started with Swift 3 - Apple WWDC 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzesJrOcFDU)

Learning from video tutorials isn't enough. If you want to have a strong foundation of Swift, I recommend you to finish the Swift - Big Nerd Ranch Guide, before messing with iOS App Development.

Also, enrolling in any iOS Development Courses on Udemy as a complete beginner (with no understanding of Swift) will not gonna help.
